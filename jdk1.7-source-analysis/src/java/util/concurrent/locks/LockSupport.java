/**
 * Basic thread blocking primitives for creating locks and other
 * synchronization classes.
 *
 * <p>This class associates, with each thread that uses it, a permit
 * (in the sense of the {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore
 * Semaphore} class). A call to {@code park} will return immediately
 * if the permit is available, consuming it in the process; otherwise
 * it <em>may</em> block.  A call to {@code unpark} makes the permit
 * available, if it was not already available. (Unlike with Semaphores
 * though, permits do not accumulate. There is at most one.)
 *
 * <p>Methods {@code park} and {@code unpark} provide efficient
 * means of blocking and unblocking threads that do not encounter the
 * problems that cause the deprecated methods {@code Thread.suspend}
 * and {@code Thread.resume} to be unusable for such purposes: Races
 * between one thread invoking {@code park} and another thread trying
 * to {@code unpark} it will preserve liveness, due to the
 * permit. Additionally, {@code park} will return if the caller's
 * thread was interrupted, and timeout versions are supported. The
 * {@code park} method may also return at any other time, for "no
 * reason", so in general must be invoked within a loop that rechecks
 * conditions upon return. In this sense {@code park} serves as an
 * optimization of a "busy wait" that does not waste as much time
 * spinning, but must be paired with an {@code unpark} to be
 * effective.
 *
 * <p>The three forms of {@code park} each also support a
 * {@code blocker} object parameter. This object is recorded while
 * the thread is blocked to permit monitoring and diagnostic tools to
 * identify the reasons that threads are blocked. (Such tools may
 * access blockers using method {@link #getBlocker}.) The use of these
 * forms rather than the original forms without this parameter is
 * strongly encouraged. The normal argument to supply as a
 * {@code blocker} within a lock implementation is {@code this}.
 *
 * <p>These methods are designed to be used as tools for creating
 * higher-level synchronization utilities, and are not in themselves
 * useful for most concurrency control applications.  The {@code park}
 * method is designed for use only in constructions of the form:
 * <pre>while (!canProceed()) { ... LockSupport.park(this); }</pre>
 * where neither {@code canProceed} nor any other actions prior to the
 * call to {@code park} entail locking or blocking.  Because only one
 * permit is associated with each thread, any intermediary uses of
 * {@code park} could interfere with its intended effects.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> Here is a sketch of a first-in-first-out
 * non-reentrant lock class:
 * <pre>{@code
 * class FIFOMutex {
 *   private final AtomicBoolean locked = new AtomicBoolean(false);
 *   private final Queue<Thread> waiters
 *     = new ConcurrentLinkedQueue<Thread>();
 *
 *   public void lock() {
 *     boolean wasInterrupted = false;
 *     Thread current = Thread.currentThread();
 *     waiters.add(current);
 *
 *     // Block while not first in queue or cannot acquire lock
 *     while (waiters.peek() != current ||
 *            !locked.compareAndSet(false, true)) {
 *        LockSupport.park(this);
 *        if (Thread.interrupted()) // ignore interrupts while waiting
 *          wasInterrupted = true;
 *     }
 *
 *     waiters.remove();
 *     if (wasInterrupted)          // reassert interrupt status on exit
 *        current.interrupt();
 *   }
 *
 *   public void unlock() {
 *     locked.set(false);
 *     LockSupport.unpark(waiters.peek());
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 * 
 * 
 * 用来创建锁和其他同步类的基本线程阻塞原语。 

此类以及每个使用它的线程与一个许可关联（从 Semaphore 类的意义上说）。如果该许可可用，并且可在进程中使用，则调用 park 将立即返回；否则可能 阻塞。如果许可尚不可用，则可以调用 unpark 使其可用。（但与 Semaphore 不同的是，许可不能累积，并且最多只能有一个许可。） 

park 和 unpark 方法提供了阻塞和解除阻塞线程的有效方法，并且不会遇到导致过时方法 Thread.suspend 和 Thread.resume 因为以下目的变得不可用的问题：由于许可的存在，调用 park 的线程和另一个试图将其 unpark 的线程之间的竞争将保持活性。此外，如果调用者线程被中断，并且支持超时，则 park 将返回。park 方法还可以在其他任何时间“毫无理由”地返回，因此通常必须在重新检查返回条件的循环里调用此方法。从这个意义上说，park 是“忙碌等待”的一种优化，它不会浪费这么多的时间进行自旋，但是必须将它与 unpark 配对使用才更高效。 

三种形式的 park 还各自支持一个 blocker 对象参数。此对象在线程受阻塞时被记录，以允许监视工具和诊断工具确定线程受阻塞的原因。（这样的工具可以使用方法 getBlocker(java.lang.Thread) 访问 blocker。）建议最好使用这些形式，而不是不带此参数的原始形式。在锁实现中提供的作为 blocker 的普通参数是 this。 

这些方法被设计用来作为创建高级同步实用工具的工具，对于大多数并发控制应用程序而言，它们本身并不是很有用。park 方法仅设计用于以下形式的构造： 

while (!canProceed()) { ... LockSupport.park(this); }在这里，在调用 park 之前，canProceed 和其他任何动作都不会锁定或阻塞。因为每个线程只与一个许可关联，park 的任何中间使用都可能干扰其预期效果
